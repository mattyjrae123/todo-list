# todo-list

[Link to live page](https://mattyjrae123.github.io/todo-list/)

This project is part of 'The Odin Project' javascript course. It's a browser based Todo List app. 

I'll be using HTML, CSS and JS but also utilising node and webpack for development tools. As the scope of this project is significantly larger than previous projects, this is a good opportunity to put everything I've learned up until this point together.

## Plan
- Design basic UI with Figma
- Design backend
- Build UI with HTMl/CSS
- Build functionality with JS

### Initial Project Scope:
- Todo 'tasks' should have a title, description, dueDate and priority
- Todo 'tasks' should be split into 'projects' or seperate 'lists
- Projects can be created/deleted by the user
- Todo tasks can be created/deleted by the user
- Seperate application logic from UI logic using modules
- 

### Advanced Scope:
- Data persistence using localStorage

#### Rough design (ignore colours)
