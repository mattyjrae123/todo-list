This project is part of 'The Odin Project' javascript course. It's a browser based Todo List app. 

I'll be using HTML, CSS and JS but also utilising node and webpack for development tools. As the scope of this project is significantly larger than previous projects, this is a good opportunity to put everything I've learned up until this point together.
